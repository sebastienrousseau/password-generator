<!--
PR description template. Global rule: see ~/Code/AGENTS.md "PR Descriptions"
and "Release Page Format" (aligned with https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp/releases/tag/v0.0.5).
Rules baked into this shape:
  - A two-line BLUF (bottom line up front) that announces the PR: line 1 begins
    "This PR " and says what it does; line 2 says why it matters or the outcome.
    Separate line 1 and line 2 each with a blank line: a single newline soft-wraps
    into one paragraph in Markdown, so a blank line is what makes each render on
    its own line. No paragraph above.
  - Never use the em dash character in the body. Use commas, colons, parentheses,
    or a spaced hyphen instead.
  - Write like a person wrote it: direct, concrete, friendly, no filler, no AI tells.
  - For external upstream maintainers, open with a bare-name greeting on its
    own line: exactly "Hi <name>," and nothing more, no thanks or extra clause.
    If the repository is the user's own (Sebastien), omit the greeting entirely
    and start directly with the BLUF.
  - No "Generated with Claude Code" or other tool-attribution footer.
Keep the sections and their order. Fill every {{PLACEHOLDER}} from real evidence.
